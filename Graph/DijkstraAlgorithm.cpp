- Dijkstra's algorithm is a generalization of BFS to graphs with non-negative weighted edges. Unlike BFS, where every edge has equal weight, here weights can vary.

The key difference:

BFS uses a queue (FIFO), which processes nodes in the order they are discovered.

Dijkstra uses a priority queue (min-heap) to always pick the next closest vertex (the one with the smallest tentative distance) to process next.

This makes Dijkstra much faster and more efficient for weighted graphs compared to a na√Øve approach where you might have to scan all vertices repeatedly.

It avoids revisiting or processing nodes in the wrong order, which BFS can't do on weighted graphs.

For graphs with negative weights, algorithms like Bellman-Ford are used.

Dijkstra finds shortest paths from a single source to all other vertices.

It is not designed for all-pairs shortest path problems (where Floyd-Warshall is used).

// Regular BFS vs PQ
/*
In unweighted graphs, all edges have the same "weight" (usually 1), so BFS naturally finds the shortest path because each step adds the same cost. Here, a simple FIFO queue suffices ‚Äî no need for a priority queue.

In weighted graphs, edges can have different costs (weights), so just visiting nodes in the order they're discovered (like BFS) won't guarantee the shortest path.

Using a priority queue (min-heap) helps always pick the vertex with the smallest tentative distance next, which avoids unnecessary exploration of longer paths early on.

This reduces the overall number of relaxations and vertex revisits, leading to a more efficient algorithm compared to scanning all vertices every time.
